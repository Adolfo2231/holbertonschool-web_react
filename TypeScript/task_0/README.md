# Task 0: Student Interface

This project involves creating a TypeScript interface for a student and rendering a table using Vanilla JavaScript. The project is set up with Webpack and ESLint for development.

## Project Structure

- **`package.json`**: Contains the project dependencies and scripts.
- **`.eslintrc.js`**: ESLint configuration file for code linting.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file for compiling TypeScript code.
- **`webpack.config.js`**: Webpack configuration file for bundling the project.
- **`js/main.ts`**: The main TypeScript file where the student interface is defined and the table is rendered.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all necessary packages.
2. **Start Development Server**: Use `npm run start-dev` to start the Webpack development server.
3. **Run Tests**: Execute `npx jest` to run the test suite.

## Requirements

- Use TypeScript for defining the student interface and variables.
- Render a table using Vanilla JavaScript.
- Ensure no type errors are present when running Webpack.

## Usage

This project demonstrates the use of TypeScript interfaces and DOM manipulation with Vanilla JavaScript. It is a simple setup to get familiar with TypeScript and Webpack.
